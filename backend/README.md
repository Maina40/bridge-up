# Recommended Backend for Bridge Up Project

- **PHP**: Your current setup uses PHP, which is suitable for handling forms, payments, and simple APIs.
- **File Storage**: For images and uploads, use the filesystem (e.g., `images/events/`).
- **Email**: Use PHP's `mail()` function or integrate with services like SMTP, SendGrid, or Mailgun for reliable email delivery.
- **Security**: Validate all user input and restrict file uploads.

**Stack Example:**
- PHP (backend logic)
- Apache or Nginx (web server)
- Optional: Use frameworks like Laravel for advanced features

**Note:**  
Currently, your project does not use a database.  
All data (e.g., feedback, images) is stored in files (like JSON or image folders).

## What should you do next?

1. **Decide if you need a database:**
   - If you want user accounts, donation tracking, or dynamic feedback, set up MySQL/MariaDB using the provided SQL schema.

2. **Connect your PHP code to the database:**
   - Update your PHP scripts to use database queries for storing/retrieving data.

3. **Secure your backend:**
   - Validate all user input.
   - Use prepared statements for database queries.
   - Restrict file uploads and access.

4. **Test all features:**
   - Try forms, uploads, and feedback to ensure everything works.

5. **Deploy and maintain:**
   - Keep your code updated.
   - Regularly back up your files and database.

**Tip:**  
If you want to add database features, import the SQL file into your MySQL server and update your PHP code to use it.
